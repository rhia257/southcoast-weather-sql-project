# South Coast Weather SQL Project

## Description
This SQL project demonstrates table creation, data insertion, and the use of JOINs to combine data from multiple tables in a weather dataset.  
It uses cities along the South Coast of England and includes average temperature and rainfall data.  

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO
- LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN
- COALESCE to handle missing values
- SELECT queries with column aliases

## Dataset
- Cities and their primary weather type
- Average temperature (Â°C)
- Average annual rainfall (mm)

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `south_coast_weather.sql` in a SQL client (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
3. Run queries sequentially to create tables, insert data, and explore JOIN queries.
4. Output will show combined city weather information, with `"N/A"` displayed for any missing data.

## Notes
- Demonstrates combining multiple datasets in SQL using JOINs.
- Can be extended to include more cities or additional weather statistics.
